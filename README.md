The code looks super ugly, but I made it without any reference and it works well.

Bugs fixed: Double clicks not possible, 4th tile can no longer be openened. 

Dark mode implemented, the choice of the color mode is remembred by the browser.

btw I am terrible at this game.
I made it with 3 equal tiles instead of 2 to make it easier to train memory. 
With less distinct shapes/numbers to track I can easier concentrate on remembering the position 
of the number rather than the number/shape itself.
