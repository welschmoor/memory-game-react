# Memory Game

The code looks super ugly, but I made it without any reference and it works well.

Double clicks not possible, 4th tile can't be openened. 

btw I am terrible at this game, but I made this game to improve. 
I made it with 3 equal tiles instead of 2 to make it easier to train memory. 
With less distinct shapes/numbers to track I can easier concentrate on remember the position 
of the number rather than the number/shape itself.
